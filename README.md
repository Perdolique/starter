# Starter pack for future awesome projects üêïüí®

## Quick start

- TODO

### Nuxt.js application

Example of Nuxt.js application is located in the `apps/nuxt` directory and works as SSR (Server-Side Rendering) application by default.

> By default configuration has two environments: `staging` and `production`. <br>
> [starter-nuxt-staging](https://starter-nuxt-staging.perd.workers.dev/) | [starter-nuxt-production](https://starter-nuxt-production.perd.workers.dev/)

To run the Nuxt.js application locally, follow these steps:

1. Run `pnpm --filter @starter/nuxt run dev` to start the development server.

#### Deployment

To deploy the Nuxt.js application, you need to prepare environment:

1. Create two workers on Cloudflare. One for `staging` and one for `production` (e.g. `starter-nuxt-staging` and `starter-nuxt-production`).
2. Connect GitHub repository to those workers and configure build settings:
   - Set your default branch as branch control setting in both workers.
   - Set build command as `pnpm run build` in both workers.
   - Set deploy command as `pnpm run deploy:staging` for staging worker.
   - Set deploy command as `pnpm run deploy:production` for production worker.
   - Set path as `apps/nuxt` in both workers.
   - For staging worker enable build for non-production branches with command `pnpm run upload:staging`. It will upload builds for every non-production branch.
   - Update worker names in `wrangler.jsonc` file accordingly.

To test deployment locally, you can use following commands:

1. Build: `pnpm --filter @starter/nuxt run build`
2. Preview: `pnpm --filter @starter/nuxt run preview`

#### Icons

By default, the project uses [client bundle mode](https://nuxt.com/modules/icon#client-bundle) for icons. It means that icon packs [should be installed](https://nuxt.com/modules/icon#iconify-dataset) separately.

To install icons, run the following command: `pnpm --filter @starter/nuxt add @iconify-json/streamline-emojis`

## Project structure

- `/` - root directory with global scripts
- `/apps` - frontend applications
- `/apps/nuxt` - Nuxt.js application boilerplate
- `/common` - shared packages
- `/common/database` - database schema, related utils, types etc.
- `/common/utils` - utility functions and helpers
- `/workers` - worker applications
- `/workers/h3-example` - H3.js example worker

## Scripts

- `update:all` - check package updates in all workspaces in interactive mode
- `update:newest` - check package updates in all workspaces and update to the newest versions interactively

## Some useful commands

- `pnpm --filter @starter/<workspace> add <package>` - adds a `package` to the `@starter/<workspace>`.
