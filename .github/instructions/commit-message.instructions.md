 # Commit message instructions

 - Begin the commit message with a single short (no more than 50 characters) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description in list format with fun emoji per each item that represents the change.
 - Do not break down the details of the changes deeply, no need to explain every changed line in details. Just short description per changes for most important changes.
 - Put emoji on the beginning of the text following the format: `-{one space}{emoji}{one space}{text}`.
 - In case packages were updated, show it in the following format: `- {package name}: {from version} -> {to version}`.
 - Do not use backtick symbol in description because it will break commit message formatting.
