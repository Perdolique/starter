# Commit Message Instructions

When writing commit messages, follow these guidelines:

- Begin the commit message with a single short (no more than 50 characters) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description in list format with fun emoji per each item that represents the change.
- Do not break down the details of the changes deeply, no need to explain every changed line in details. Just short description per changes for most important changes.
- Put emoji on the beginning of the text following the format: `-{one space}{emoji}{one space}{text}`.
- In case packages were updated, show it in the following format: `- {package name}: {from version} -> {to version}`.
- Do not use backtick symbol in description because it will break commit message formatting.
- For monorepo, use the following format for the commit message:
  - {package name}: {short description of the change}
